                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★ ★</h2>
                <p>I initially thought it was OK. I wrote the majority of the Bootstrap, and spent a lot of time going through
                    each of the forms making sure they were accurate. I tried hard to keep them streamlined and formatted
                    nicely. The problem I had was when the forms were validated. They all failed miserably. I didn't even
                    know about HTML validation, but I do now!! The forms were then of course...validated.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h3 class="text-center">How well did you follow best practices in development?</h3>
                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★</h2>
                <p>If I'm honest I didn't. At least not at the start. This was mainly due to the fact that I didn't even know
                    what the best practices were, and I was really only concentrating on producing code. It wasn't until
                    the validation shenanigans mentioned above that I thought I should take a serious look at it.

                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">How well did you use appropriate version control?</h3>
                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★ ★ ★</h2>
                <p>I was a committed committer to GIT. I tended to push my changes as soon as I had finished a change to a form.
                    This was largely driven out of the fear of either; someone pulling anything other than the most recent
                    version which meant possibly having to deal with some sort of unusual merge situation, or something happening
                    to my local copy and losing my changes. The graph below shows my GIT commits during the project.

                <h3 class="text-center">To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?</h3>
                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★ ★ ★ ★</h2>
                <p>I think I contributed at least as much as anyone else. I did a lot of research, building, and fine tuning
                    of the Bootstrap HTML. I also handled all the client interaction after the initial meeting. After the
                    forms were built I tried to learn and help with some of the back end build and troubleshooting as well.</p>
