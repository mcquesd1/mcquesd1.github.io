                    <p>
                        Compared to the 15 other papers I had taken during the BIT, Software Engineering was like entering some strange twightlight
                        zone. On the one hand it was filled with scary and unfamiliar teaching methods, but on the other
                        it also came with a familiar and reassuring soundtrack. I mean who doesn't like John Fogerty and
                        Supertramp?
                    </p>
                    <p>Day one and we were into it: Form a group, develop some software. My jaw was on the floor at the fast
                        pace of it. I was left wondering what had happened to my rote learning Power Point paradise. The
                        one where you could go quietly through the motions, little to no brain required, then cram like no-one
                        was watching, and still walk away with an A. Not this time! This was instantly engaging and there
                        was work to be done.
                    </p>

                    <p>I made a suggestion to use C# for the spinner project simply because everyone in the group had done the
                        programming 2 paper so had experience with it. After some research it quickly became apparent that
                        there was a better way. I found a great example using HTML. This was a good learning point for me.
                        I needed to be open to, and embrace other ways, languages and methods. Even if I wasn't familiar
                        with them. I ended up putting this very notion into practice during the project.</p>

                    <p>During the first few weeks we also learnt about various frameworks and methodologies. These would help
                        us by providing structure to the madness that software engineering can be. We learnt how to increase
                        our professional proficiency by using tools such as GIT, Slack, Trello. We also looked at Agile and
                        were introduced to sprints and scrumming. We began to employ these tools into our spinner project
                        and for me it was a relief to have that structure around the process. I found Kanban very effective
                        in particular for providing a great overall view of the project.</p>

                    <p>The spinner was taking shape nicely and we spent a lot of time as a group working on our code in class.
                        Initially I found this very difficult. I have never rated myself as a coder, to the point of being
                        a little self conscious about my ability or lack thereof. I had always preferred to work away quietly
                        by myself. But after initially just watching, it was obvious that having creative input from many
                        people really enhanced the project. Bouncing ideas off each other, or building on someone’s suggestion
                        made for an improved overall product. Another benefit I saw was having more than one set of eyes
                        for picking up syntax errors. The number of times you would be staring at code for ages wondering
                        why it wasn't working, then someone finds the issue straight away. I can now see the value of group
                        coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>Week three already and we presented our spinner. During the whole build I was freaking out because I
                        had found and copied basically the entire spinner code. I assumed that we were supposed to build
                        it from scratch so I was extremely relieved when Adon mentioned that copy + paste was OK. Adon also
                        delivered an education power point that day, and a couple of things stood out for me. Firstly the
                        suggestion that the Polytech wants programs to fit into a bell curve, and that they aren’t challenging
                        enough if they don’t and too many people achieve highly. My belief is that the Polytech should set
                        programs based on what skillset a graduate needs to enter the workforce in their chosen field. If
                        that is attainable by all the students, so be it. The other thing I found interesting was looking
                        at the education system and self-teaching ideas. The software engineering paper is largely self-driven.
                        Initially I found this completely over whelming. However after initial panic at the realisation that
                        I wasn’t going to be spoon fed, I began to enjoy it, and it was refreshing to hear ideas like “you
                        don’t need to know everything” because there are so many resources available these days. This was
                        a major change for me as I had always thought the goal was knowledge retention. The only concern
                        I had with the self-driven method was that you might do something that isn’t best practice, and I
                        would have benefitted from more guidance in this area. I think more emphasis on best practice would
                        have complimented the self-driven method nicely, especially because when you are under pressure trying
                        to produce code, it can be easy to forget about the need to follow best practices.</p><br><br><br>

                    <h2 class="text-center"><b>The Project</b></h2><br>
                    <img src="./AC.jpg" alt="post img" class="pull-right img-responsive thumb margin10 img-thumbnail" id="ac">
                    <p>I was part of the Aviation Claims Ltd project. The task was to convert their paper based systems into
                        an online platform. Our team was largely made up of the same people from the mini project so already
                        knowing each other made things easier from the start. That combined with the practice run of the
                        mini project left me feeling confident of the task ahead. </p>
                    <p>We discussed the technology we would use; HTML for the claim forms, with PHP, and a database for the
                        back end. The client, Derek, wanted his forms to be responsive and Elise suggested we use Bootstrap.
                        I had never heard of it, but with my newly found “embrace new concepts” mantra on board, I was keen.
                        I started researching Bootstrap and began with <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-training-tutorials/1421-0.html"
                            target="new"> this tutorial on Lynda.</a> We had our first meeting with Derek and he outlined his
                        grand vision for the aviation insurance industry. We narrowed the scope and agreed that we would
                        concentrate only on the claims handling. The meeting lasted for three hours which was probably twice
                        as long as it needed to be. It was frustrating at times as we seemed to go over the same things multiple
                        times. I guess we could have steered the meeting a little better.
                    </p>
                    <p> We set up the tools to help us manage the project. We started a Kanban board on Trello. We went a bit
                        crazy and threw tons of tasks up there, which were then assigned to group members. I initially used
                        this a lot by, as well as helping to manage the board by updating task statuses, also creating new
                        ones as the project developed, and reminding the team that if they had nothing to do to check the
                        Kanban for work. However once I knew what part of the project I'd being working on, I didn't really
                        use it at all. I had a pretty good idea of what I needed to be doing. I could have used it better
                        by taking my own advice and checking in a bit more often than I did at the end because I did overlook
                        a couple of tasks. A screenshot of our Kanban board can be found on the<a href="links.html" target="new"> links & resources page.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>I made up a demo Bootstrap form example and we used that to convert all the paper forms to HTML. We split
                        into two groups, three of us on form conversion, and two looking at a likely database layout. Our
                        form conversion strategy turned out to be a mistake. The demo was really only a couple of form fields
                        so the majority of conversion was open to individual interpretation. This resulted in each form being
                        different which is not what we wanted. In hindsight we should have constructed an entire form as
                        a group, agreed upon all design aspects, and only then made the other forms.</p>
                    <p>
                        We were asked to create our milestones and as a group we thought we had so much time to cover everything. So much that we
                        would be all wrapped up by the end of October. But as we broke the project into smaller pieces, we
                        realised just how complicated it was. Needless to say the timelines and deadlines were slowly but
                        surely creeping out and being missed. Not helping was that we were only meeting at the scheduled
                        class times. Sometimes people couldn’t make it, and at scheduled class times sometimes you had to
                        do other things. Like present our milestones. Initially I thought this was a waste of time. After
                        an hour or so watching all the groups present, I still felt the same. We relied on having this time
                        to meet, discuss, write code, and move foward as a team, and we had already shown our milestones
                        a week earlier. I think not being able to meet as a group often enough had an effect on us. Slack
                        is good, but I think physically meeting more often would have kept us moving forward at a faster
                        pace.
                    </p>
                    <p> When we did meet we would hold a scrum, or a less formal version of one (no scrum master etc), and generally
                        these worked really well. As a group we noted any questions for Derek, solved any technical problems,
                        and looked at what we needed to do next. I always left feeling as though they were worthwhile and
                        that they kept everyone moving in the right direction.
                        <p/>
                        <p>As far as thinking about our project adhering to the Agile philosiphy, I guess we did to a certain
                            extent. At the beginning we were producing examples early and often for Derek to provide feedback.
                            We didn't just dictate the design. We were concious of the need to include him and to think of
                            the processes he would use in his business. We did face changing requirements often as we developed
                            the project, and many times after consultation with Derek we would need to find an improved way
                            to handle form data. For example, combining multiple fields into a pick lists, or the adding
                            of the clone code to handle duplicate form elements such as multiple insurers, passengers or
                            witnesses. I think those two aspects of Agile have merit. Producing code early seems good, as
                            long as it works OK!, and welcoming changing requirements is a no brainer after all, you should
                            always want the best possible product for the client. Here is a copy of <a href="QA.pdf" target="new"> our Q & A with Derek .</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I spent the bulk of the project working on the Bootstrap. Although the Bootstrap was never fully
                            finished. When this was at a stage where it was ready for database intergration I asked the group
                            to show me how the PHP worked and teach me how to write some of the modals and form controllers. blah blah something something
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall I have felt the full range emotions during my software engineering experience. At times I have felt frustrated, overwhelmed,
                            challenged, and disappointed that we couldn't produce a working product for our client. That
                            said, I have also had a lot of fun with the group, felt satisfied with what I have produced,
                            and that ultimately I'm better off for the experience. I feel I have definitely learnt a lot
                            during this journey, which seems ironic because of its largely self driven nature. But I think
                            as well learning the Software Engineering frameworks here, you tend to learn a lot of intangible
                            things too, like dealing with the group dynamics, interpersonal relations, and about your own
                            strengths, weaknesses and how you could personally improve which is all valuable stuff.
                        </p>
