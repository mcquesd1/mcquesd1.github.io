            <p>
                Compared to the 15 other papers I had taken during the BIT, Software Engineering was like entering some strange Twightlight zone. On the one hand it was filled with scary and unfamiliar teaching methods, but on the other it also came with a familiar and
                reassuring soundtrack. I mean who doesn't like John Fogerty and Supertramp?
            </p>
            <p>Day one and we were into it: Form a group, develop some software. My jaw was on the floor at the fast pace of it. I was left wondering what had happened to my rote learning Power Point paradise. The one where you could go quietly through the
                motions, little to no brain required, then cram like no-one was watching, and still walk away with an A. Not this time! This was instantly engaging and there was work to be done.
            </p>

            <p>I made a suggestion to use C# for the spinner project simply because everyone in the group had done the programming 2 paper so had experience with it. After some research it quickly became apparent that there was a better way. I found a great
                example using HTML. This was a good learning point for me. I needed to be open to, and embrace other ways, languages and methods. Even if I wasn't familiar with them. I ended up putting this very notion into practice during the project.</p>

            <p>During the first few weeks we also learnt about various frameworks and methodologies. These would help us by providing structure to the madness that software engineering can be. We learnt how to increase our professional proficiency by using
                tools such as GIT, Slack, Trello. We also looked at Agile and were introduced to sprints and scrumming. We began to employ these tools into our spinner project and for me it was a relief to have that structure around the process. I found
                Kanban very effective in particular for providing a great overall view of the project.</p>

            <p>The spinner was taking shape nicely and we spent a lot of time as a group working on our code in class. Initially I found this very difficult. I have never rated myself as a coder, to the point of being a little self-conscious about my ability
                or lack thereof. I had always preferred to work away quietly by myself. But after initially just watching, it was obvious that having creative input from many people really enhanced the project. Bouncing ideas off each other, or building
                on someone’s suggestion made for an improved overall product. Another benefit I saw was having more than one set of eyes for picking up syntax errors. The number of times you would be staring at code for ages wondering why it wasn't working,
                then someone finds the issue straight away. I can now see the value of group coding and it is now my preference.
            </p>
            <p>Week three already and we presented our spinner. During the whole build I was freaking out because I had found and copied basically the entire spinner code. I assumed that we were supposed to build it from scratch so I was extremely relieved
                when Adon mentioned that copy + paste was OK. Adon also delivered an education power point that day, and a couple of things stood out for me. Firstly the suggestion that the Polytech wants programs to fit into a bell curve, and that they
                aren’t challenging enough if they don’t and too many people achieve highly. My belief is that the Polytech should set programs based on what skillset a graduate needs to enter the workforce in their chosen field. If that is attainable
                by all the students, so be it. The other thing I found interesting was looking at the education system and self-teaching ideas. The software engineering paper is largely self-driven. Initially I found this completely over whelming. However
                after initial panic at the realisation that I wasn’t going to be spoon fed, I began to enjoy it, and it was refreshing to hear ideas like “you don’t need to know everything” because there are so many resources available these days. This
                was a major change for me as I had always thought the goal was knowledge retention.
                <font color="red">(1) "</font>
                The only concern I had with the self-driven method was that you might do something that isn’t best practice, and I would have benefitted from more guidance in this area. I think more emphasis on best practice would have complimented the self-driven method
                nicely, especially because when you are under pressure trying to produce code, it can be easy to forget about the need to follow best practices.

                <b>The Project</b>
            </h2>

            <img src="./AC.jpg" alt="post img" class="pull-right img-responsive thumb margin10 img-thumbnail" id="ac">
            <p>I was part of the Aviation Claims Ltd project. The task was to convert their paper based systems into an online platform. Our team was largely made up of the same people from the mini project so already knowing each other made things easier
                from the start. That combined with the practice run of the mini project left me feeling confident of the task ahead. </p>
            <p>We discussed the technology we would use; HTML for the claim forms, with PHP, and a database for the back end. The client, Derek, wanted his forms to be responsive and Elise suggested we use Bootstrap. I had never heard of it, but with my
                newly found “embrace new concepts” mantra on board, I was keen. I started researching Bootstrap and began with
                <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-training-tutorials/1421-0.html" target="new"> this tutorial on Lynda.</a> We had our first meeting with Derek and he outlined his grand vision for the aviation insurance industry. We narrowed the
                scope and agreed that we would concentrate only on the claims handling. The meeting lasted for three hours which was probably twice as long as it needed to be.
                <font color="red">(2) "</font>It was frustrating at times as we seemed to go over the same things multiple times. I guess we could have steered the meeting a little better.
                <font color="red">"</font>
            </p>
            <p> We set up the tools to help us manage the project. We started a Kanban board on Trello. We went a bit crazy and threw tons of tasks up there, which were then assigned to group members. I initially used this a lot by, along with the other group
                members, managing the board by updating task statuses, creating new tasks as the project developed, and at the beginning, reminding the team that if they had nothing to do to check the Kanban for work. </p>
            <center>
                <img src="slackw1.JPG" alt="slack screenshot">
            </center>
            <p> However once I knew which part of the project I'd being working on, I didn't really use it at all. I had a pretty good idea of what I needed to be doing. I could have used the Kanban better by taking my own advice and checking in a bit more
                often than I did at the end because I did overlook a couple of tasks. A screenshot of our Kanban board can be found on the
                <a href="links.html">
                        links & resources page.</a>
            </p>
            <p>I made up a demo Bootstrap form example and we used that to convert all the paper forms to HTML. We split into two groups, three of us on form conversion, and two looking at a likely database layout. Our form conversion strategy turned out
                to be a mistake. The demo was really only a couple of form fields so the majority of conversion was open to individual interpretation. This resulted in each form being different which is not what we wanted. In hindsight we should have
                constructed an entire form as a group, agreed upon all design aspects, and only then made the other forms.</p>
            <p>
                We were asked to create our milestones and as a group we thought we had so much time to cover everything. So much so that we would be all wrapped up by the end of October. But as we broke the project into smaller pieces, we realised just how complicated
                it was, and the build turned out to be really time consuming. Needless to say the timelines and deadlines were slowly but surely creeping out and being missed.
                <font color="red"> (3) "</font>Not helping was that, apart from once during the holidays, we were only meeting at the scheduled class times. Sometimes people couldn’t make it, and at scheduled class times sometimes you had to do other things.
                <font color="red">"</font>

                Like present our milestones. Initially I thought this was a waste of time. After an hour or so watching all the groups present, I still felt the same. We relied on having this time to meet, discuss, write code, and move forward as a team, and we had already
                shown our milestones a week earlier. I think not meeting as a group often enough slowed our progress a little. Slack is good, but I think physically meeting more often would have kept us moving forward at a faster pace.
            </p>
            <p> When we did meet we would hold a scrum, or a less formal version of one
                <font color="red"> (4) "</font>(no scrum master etc.)
                <font color="red">"</font>, and generally these worked really well. As a group we noted any questions for Derek, solved or worked on any technical problems, and looked at what we needed to do next. I always left feeling as though they were worthwhile and
                that they kept everyone moving in the right direction.
            </p>
            <p>As far as thinking about our project adhering to the Agile philosophy, I guess we did to a certain extent. At the beginning we were producing examples early and often for Derek to provide feedback. We didn't just dictate the design. We were
                conscious of the need to include him and to think of the processes he would use in his business. We did face changing requirements often as we developed the project, and many times after consultation with Derek we would need to find an
                improved way to handle form data. For example, combining multiple fields into a pick lists, or the adding of the clone code to handle duplicate form elements such as multiple insurers, passengers or witnesses. I think those two aspects
                of Agile have merit. Producing code early seems good, as long as it works OK!, and welcoming changing requirements is a no brainer after all, you should always want the best possible product for the client. Here is a copy of
                <a href="QA.pdf" target="new">
                            our Q & A with Derek .</a>
            </p>
            <p>I spent the bulk of the project working on the Bootstrap. I asked the guys working on the back end to show and teach me some PHP too. I made a couple of models and started a form controller, and it was pleasing to have a hand in almost all
                of the different aspects of the project. I have certainly learnt a lot from it and have a better understanding of how all the pieces fit together.
            </p>
            <p>
                With only a few weeks to go it became obvious that we weren't going to finish the project. We then decided to concentrate on producing one complete form. We came close, but never finished it. We have completed the claim forms as far as layout goes. There
                is a database in place to store the form data. The unfinished areas are the PHP and form integration. We never quite nailed the file upload handling. We also didn't get on to pulling data from the database and creating reports.</p>
            <p>
                Overall I have felt the full range emotions during my software engineering experience. At times I have felt frustrated, overwhelmed, challenged, and disappointed that we couldn't produce a working product for our client. That said, I have also had a lot
                of fun with the group, felt satisfied with what I have produced, and that ultimately I'm better off for the experience. I feel I have definitely learnt a lot during this journey, which seems ironic because of its largely self-driven nature.
                But I think as well as learning the software engineering frameworks here, you tend to learn a lot of intangible things too, like dealing with the group dynamics, interpersonal relations, and about your own strengths, weaknesses and how
                you could personally improve which is all valuable stuff.

                            <p>This was a fleeting thought for me during the first part of the course, but really reared its head when during project the forms I created failed validation and were causing issues with the database integration. I was so focused
                                on just writing the code, I didn't even think of whether what I was doing was right, only that it looked OK. A gentle prodding or reminder would have made me include best practice into my work before the shit hit the fan.
                                This of course is all by the by now because I have learnt from this experience and would now know to include best practices from the start in all my future work.

                            <p>This was a conscious decision and an oversight. We initially thought that we would easily complete this project so only meeting at those times would be adequate. That turned out to be an oversite as the project developed and
                                it became obvious that progress was painfully slow, especially in between meetings, so I think extra meetings would have definitely helped to advance the project. We seemed to get our best work done when we were together
                                as a group or pair programming.

                                <p>At the beginning of this project, the formal structure of the scrum was definitely needed. There was a bit of head banging amongst some group members so the structure provided a way for everyone to give their input. After
                                    that though things appeared to relax a little and I felt our group dynamic was such that it allowed everyone to have their say, and that we didn't need that formal structure to enable an open and equal discussion. However,
                                    I talked to Albert about it, and he said he struggled with not having that structure around our meetings. My initial thoughts around scrumming were that they were a bit over the top, but having given it some more thought,
                                    and especially after listening to Albert, I would insist on them, and in the most formal structure possible so they can be as effective as possible for all team members. </p>
