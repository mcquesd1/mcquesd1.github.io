        <p>Project was a combination of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ops work with the BIT platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learning about the DevOps pipeline, Azure and AWS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating various modules for my employer. <a href="tprof.html">Click here for more.</a>

                <p>Gitlab was down which was a headache for a lot of people in the BIT. It was the Ops team that had the pleasure of trying to get it working again. I shadowed James the 2nd year project guy as he / we tried to fix it. Really I had little idea as to what was going on. The certificates needed renewing on the gitlab server and the gateway. Once that was done there was still an error appearing to come from the IDP. 
                         I had been reading the wiki trying to get a feel for the landscape. I read that the IDP needed keys updated every January. I messaged this to James. He passed this on to Rob. This turned out to be the problem holding it up, so I was happy 
                        that I had at least made a small contribution to the team.</p>

                Week 2 was about settling on a path for the semester. For me that was going to be a combination of learning about DevOps concepts, Azure and AWS, as well as completing a project for my employer.
                <h4>DevOps</h4>
                <p>I learned of the CI/CD pipeline. I watched a couple of intructional videos on <a target="new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jav4vbUrqII&t=314s">how to setup a Gitlab pipeline</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MBhxk2chhM&pbjreload=10">how to setup a runner.</a> The runner proved difficult and I could not get it working. </p>
                <center><img src="failedPipeline.png" width="500px" alt="slack screenshot"></center>
                <h4>Azure</h4>
                <p>As I knew nothing of Azure I started the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/" target="new">Fundamentals learning path.</a> This consisted of 12 modules covering the basics. I created an Azure account and checked out the portal. </p>
            </p><br>
            <h4>Work Project</h4>
            <p>This week I worked on: </p>
            <ul><li>Confirming data required in key persons Sharepoint list.</li>
                <li>Troubleshoot date issue on data upload. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>DevOps / Azure</h4>
            <p>Now that I had created an Azure account I used this to try and get my Gitlab runner up, and did the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Created a Linux VM in Azure.</li>
                <li>Used this guide to <a target="new" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04">install docker on Ubuntu.</a></li>
                <center><img src="dockerInstall.png" width="700px" alt="slack screenshot"></center><br>
                <li><a target="new" href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/docker.html">Installed Gitlab runner on a container.</a></li>
                <li><a target="new" href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html#docker">Register the Docker runner.</a></li>
              </ul>
             This proved sucessful and my pipeline was now working with the newly created docker runner.</p>

                <p>This week I watched an <a target="new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3SYDTMP3ME&t=1671s">AWS introductory video</a>, and completed the <a target="new" href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/break-monolith-app-microservices-ecs-docker-ec2/module-one/">"Break the monolith"</a> project, 
                  which separates a monolithic application into microservices using AWS technologies.
             
                 </p><br>
            <h4>Ops</h4>
            <p>As a group we decided that we needed a ticketing system as the current one was broken. Rather than have to maintain our own,
              it was decided to see what hosted options were available. Matthew and I had a look at a few options and settled on Freshdesk. Matthew set up
              the system and we trialled it briefly. The current system (Zammad) by then had been fixed, so we went with that in the end. I knew nothing about Zammad so thought it might be a good oppurtunity to learn more.
             I created a new Linux VM in my Azure portal and sucessfully installed Zammad by following <a target="new" href="https://websiteforstudents.com/how-to-install-zammad-ticketing-system-on-ubuntu-18-04-16-04/"> this guide.</a>

                          Azure services, and enabled me to get some hands on experience with the platform. From here I will look at an administrator learning path.</p>

                            explaining how lab services works and how to create one. </p>
