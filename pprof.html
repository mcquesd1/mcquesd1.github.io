                <h3 class="text-center">How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h3>
                
                <p>It was a baptism of fire, Gitlab was down many unhappy campers, Rob had been getting around 2000 emails a day from the BITplatform. Something was wrong with the staging servers and or the NAS.
                    The priority was gitlab as it was relied upon by so many different papers in the BIT. I shadowed James the 2nd year project guy as he / we tried to fix it. Really I had little idea as to what was going on. The certificates needed renewing on the gitlab server and the gateway. Once that was done there was still an error appearing to come from the IDP. 
                     I had been reading the wiki trying to get a feel for the landscape. I read that the IDP needed keys updated every January. I messaged this to James. He passed this on to Rob. This turned out to be the problem, so I was happy 
                    that I had made a contribution.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">How well did you communicate with others in your group?</h3>
                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★ ★ ★ ★</h2>
                <p>Our slack channel was our main form of communication during the project. I used it a lot, and was conscious
                    of the importance to "stay in touch" with the group. I used Slack to share code snippets and client correspondence,
                    arrange meetings, praise and encourage the other group members, and just chat about various aspects of
                    the project. I also found it useful for experimenting with, and honing my emoji use. By the end of the
                    project I found I had used emojis that I had previously only dreamed of using in an actual conversation.
                    Below is a small sample of my Slack activity providing evidence of my contribution to the group. A more
                    comprehensive record can be found on the<a href="links.html"> links & resources page.</a></p>

                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★ ★</h2>
                <p>I wasn't great at documenting anything. At the beginning I wasn't even commenting the HTML until I saw what
                    Bettina was doing. After seeing that I made more of an effort to comment my work, and it certainly helped
                    later on with things like navigating the pages and identifying script functions.

                <h2 class="text-center">★ ★ ★ ★</h2>
                <p>This project had a lot of twists and turns. Firstly because there were so many forms, all with slightly different
                    wording, or requirements. Regularly we would come across things we were unsure of, or things we had assumed
                    that turned out to be not the case at all once we had clarified with Derek. There were also obvious differences
                    between storing data on a piece of paper compared to a database. We often had to add additional form
                    elements to correctly store data after receiving feedback from Derek. For my part, making changes all
                    the time didn't really bother me, and I think as a group we handled these changes very well. </p>
